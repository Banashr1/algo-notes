# Cut Tiles

This is a problem from Google APAC Test([link to problem](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3214486/dashboard#s=p3)). 
There are two different solutions. One is based on recursion and the other is based on an observation that
each tile's length of edge are all one power of 2 so we can split place left for the larger tiles to put
smaller tiles in.

A solution in detail can be found [here](http://www.yumumu.me/Cut_Tiles/).
